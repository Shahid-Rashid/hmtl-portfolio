--How to use HTML--
HTML short for Hyper text Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It consists of a series f elments and tags that define the layout, headings, paragraph, images, links, and other elemets within a webpage.
Hyper Text is a text which contains links to other texts, coined by Ted Nelson in 1956.
Markup language is the specific tags and attributes used to create those hyperlinks.

In HTML we have tags that we use for different purposes, like heading tag <h></h>:
Heading tag is used to create to headings of our content, and it can range form 1 to 6, with the size decreasing the higher the number.
